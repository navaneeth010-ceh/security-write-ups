# Lab: Remote code execution via web shell upload

**Vulnerability:**

Unrestricted File Upload → Remote Code Execution (RCE)

**Overview:**

The application allows users to upload avatar files without properly validating the file type or preventing server-side execution of uploaded PHP files.

By uploading a malicious PHP file and then accessing it through the application's /files/avatars/ directory, it is possible to execute arbitrary PHP code on the server.

**Attack Chain:**

1. While proxying traffic through Burp, log in to your account and notice the option for uploading an avatar image.
2. Upload an arbitrary image, then return to your account page. Notice that a preview of your avatar is now displayed on the page.
3. In Burp, go to Proxy > HTTP history. Click the filter bar to open the HTTP history filter window. Under Filter by MIME type, enable the Images checkbox, then apply your changes.
4. In the proxy history, notice that your image was fetched using a GET request to /files/avatars/<YOUR-IMAGE>. Send this request to Burp Repeater.

5. On your system, create a file called exploit.php, containing a script for fetching the contents of Carlos's secret file. For example:
<?php echo file_get_contents('/home/carlos/secret'); ?>
6. Use the avatar upload function to upload your malicious PHP file. The message in the response confirms that this was uploaded successfully.

7. In Burp Repeater, change the path of the request to point to your PHP file:
GET /files/avatars/exploit.php HTTP/1.1
8. Send the request. Notice that the server has executed your script and returned its output (Carlos's secret) in the response.
9. Submit the secret to solve the lab. 

**Impact:**

- The vulnerability allows an attacker to upload a server-side executable file and execute arbitrary code on the server.
- Depending on the application's privileges and server configuration, this could potentially lead to:
- Sensitive file disclosure
- Unauthorized access to application data
- Modification or deletion of server-side files
- Further compromise of the application or underlying server
